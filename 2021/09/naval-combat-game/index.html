<b>Why I made this game:</b> I have made tabletop games in the past but my issue has always been making efficient use of my components. Especially since I eventually want to start publishing my games, keeping the cost low is a very real design constraint that I wanted to challenge myself to meet. This got me thinking about card games, and how while I love ccgs/lcgs/card games I always lamented the fact that the placement of ships usually does not matter at all (shoutout to Summoner's War and Faeria, both card games that are played on a board). I also wanted to see if there was a way that I could move away from the mana system. To achieve the movement portion of this game, I borrowed mechanics from war games, and any Diplomacy players reading this might recognize some similarities in the "support" and "retreat" mechanics. The issue with not having a mana system is that there is no "ramp" to continually raise the stakes and keep players interested, so I added in islands onto the game board that grant additional draw per turn if captured. I also gave the strongest ships downsides and the weakest ships upsides so that all cards are the same cost but still have variance. The theme came after the mechanics were finalized, and I went with a naval theme because it seemed like a good fit given the relative emptiness of the board and the fog of war element.


<h2>RULES</h2>


<b>Ways to win the game:</b> <br>
1. Capture the opponent's country and hold it until the end of their turn.<br>
2. Sink 7 of your opponent's ships.<br>

<b>Overview:</b><br>
This game is a turn-based card game played on a 5x4 board. 
<br>
<b>Set Up:</b> <br>
Place the countries and islands in the following configuration:
<br>
 player 1<br>
- - c - -<br>
i - - - -<br>
- - - - i<br>
- - c - -<br>
 player 2<br>


i = island<br>
c = country<br>
- = empty space large enough to accommodate a card<br>

Each player takes one copy of each other card (except the player aid, put this to the side) to make their deck. All players shuffle their decks and draw 2 cards. <br>

<b>Turn structure:</b><br>
-At the start of the turn, the turn player draws 3 cards. (+1 if they have a ship on top of at least 1 island)<br>
-The player may then take any number of the following actions:<br>
1. Play a ship from the hand face-down on, to the right, or to the left of their country.<pbr>
2. Move a ship to an adjacent square and discard 1 card. <br>

<b>Attacking:</b><br>
When a ship is moved onto a square occupied by an opponent's ship, an attack is initiated. The ship attempting to move into the square is the attacker and the ship currently in the square is the target.<br>

1. The attacker may choose supports (add the attack value of adjacent ships to the target by discarding 1 card per ship)<br>
2. The defender may choose to retreat by discarding 1 card if there is a valid space to retreat to (the attacker moves the target to an empty adjacent square that the attack did not come from, moves into the space the target was in, then skips the next steps. No battle actually happens)<br>
3. The defender may choose supports (add the attack value of adjacent ships to the target by discarding 1 card per ship)<br>
4. The attacker, target, and supporting cards are all revealed and the attack total of each side is computed. The side with the higher attack total wins. If the attackers win, they occupy the space and the target is sinked. If the defense wins, nothing occurs. The defense wins ties.<br>

<b>Sinking ships:</b><br>
A sunk ship is removed from the game permanently. It should be placed face-up in a pile separate from the discard pile. [Reminder: normal discards are face-down.]
<br>
<b>Capturing islands:</b><br>
An island is considered captured as long as a ship is on that same square. Players draw 1 card if they have captured an island at the start of their turn in addition to their normal draw. There is no direct benefit from controlling both islands, but it does deprive the opponent of controlling any islands, and thus impacts their draw.<br>

<b>Capturing countries: </b><br>
If an enemy ship is on the turn player's country at the end of the turn player's turn, the turn player loses.<br>

<b>Running out of cards:</b><br>
Shuffle your discards and make a new deck. Do not shuffle back in sinked ships. If there are still not enough cards to draw, no more cards are drawn.
<br>
<b>Face up vs. face down ships:</b><br>
A ship can only use its abilities if it is face up. You can flip your own ships face-up at any time during either player's turn. They cannot be flipped back face-down once they are face-up. Ships are also flipped face-up at the end of combat.
<br>
<b>Adjacency:</b><br>
Adjacency is cardinal and not diagonal.
<br>
<b>Placement:</b><br>
Two ships can never be in the same exact space on the board.
<br>
<b>Speed Variant:</b><br>
For faster games, a player wins once they sink 6 ships.

<h2>Change history: </h2>
12/08/2021: Added Silent Ships and Silent Planes Print and Play files. 
<br>
11/12/2021: Now that this game is published, this change log is just here for those interested.
<br>
10/16/2021: Flag ship now no longer loses the game but sinks 2 ships from your deck, discard, or hand. I did this because losing the game outright feels a bit too sudden and extremely punishing. It is still really bad to lose the Flag Ship. Fire Ship was slightly buffed. You can discard 1 card to discard the Fire Ship instead of sinking it after it is successfully used. This fixes one of the major issues with Fire Ship, being that it can effectively only be used once in the game. I don't think it will be too strong because you lose card advantage but there could be a strategy where you purposely sink your other ships to loop the Fire ship every turn. Possibly too strong in the late game. Speed Boat got a small rewording to make it more clear. Ammunition Ship has been removed from the game and replaced with Firefighting Ship. This was due to a small communication goof with the artist, but actually I was never really happy with Ammunition Ship. The effect is that if an adjacent ship would sink, you can discard 1 card to return it to the hand instead. This can protect a flag ship extremely well or just in general prevent your ships from being permanently sunk. That said, once your opponent knows about the Firefighting Ship they are sure to take the opportunity to sink it as it has 0 attack. Art added for some of the ships.

9/22/2021: Cards are now horizontal instead of vertical since ships generally are quite wide and this allows for full-card art. Special Operations Craft reverted to original effect. Retreats now occur before an attacker declares supports. Heavily considering having the defender declare supports before the attacker in order to further reduce the ability to stall, but decided to hold off for now.
<br>
9/19/2021: Ammunition ship is now +3 attack, and ramming ship is 4 attack on the opponent's turn.
<br>
9/17/2021: For thematic reasons, changed the terminology "unit" to "ship" and changed the terminology of "captured" to "sink." Additionally, Salvage ship now has 2 base attack but has +1 attack per opposing ship sunk. Special Operations Craft now has an entirely new ability that swaps itself with any sunk unit when on an island/opponent's country. Speed boat now has 4 base attack and can move up to 3 spaces in one move. Additionally, players now draw 3 cards per turn instead of 2. This makes the game more "swingy" and speeds it up overall.
<br>
9/15/2021: You can play the game online on Tabletopia here: <a href="https://tabletopia.com/playground/silent-ships-b488yr/play-now">https://tabletopia.com/playground/silent-ships-b488yr/play-now</a>


<br>
9/14/2021: Named the game "Silent Ships"
<br>
9/13/2021: Added clarification that a unit with no available retreats cannot retreat, and that the attacker occupies the space it is attacking if the defender chooses to retreat. Additionally, updated Fire Ship's card text to reflect that it is captured after defending, and also fixed the player guide which incorrectly listed step 4 of combat as step 3.
