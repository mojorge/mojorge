<h1>Number Line</h1>

Idea behind this game: A friend and I were considering a situation in which 3 players had to guess a number between 1-10. The person who guessed the closest number won. What is the best strategy and how can each player maximize their chances of guessing the right number? Interestingly, the strategy here is somewhat complex. If the first person simply chooses 5, they can be "surrounded" by the other 2 players who guess 6 and 4. Thus, this game was born. Ultimately, I think this problem is technically solvable. In this game, round 1 is essentially this initial solvable state, which is somewhat unfortunate because solved games can be boring. Although with all multiplayer games collusion is generally possible, so I think there is still more to explore there. "Round 2" is a more gamified version where a decoy card can spice things up because this allows for bluffing.
<br>
<br>
	
<p>This game is a competitive game in which
players try to earn the most points across two 
rounds.
<br>
SET UP: Place the number cards 1-10 face-up
in a row, ordered lowest to highest.
The Starting Player is the player who can
calculate 17 * 34 the fastest in their head.
<br>
Win when: At the end of round 2, have the
most points.
<br>
Round 1: Each player chooses a color and gets
those respective cards. Players take turns 
starting with the starting player and continuing
clockwise by playing 1 card on top of a number 
card that does not already have a number on 
top of it. The round ends when all players have 
placed exactly 1 card. Score this round, then
reset the game to the SET UP position.
<br>
Round 2: This is the same as round 1, except
players now continue until they play 2 cards.
Additionally, 1 card is a "decoy" that does not
count during scoring.
<br>
Scoring: Players get 1 point for every number
their card is closer to than any other's card. 
This includes the number that their card is on.
Neither player scores points for ties.
<br>

Changing the starting player: The starting
player should rotate clockwise between 
rounds, and you can keep track of this with
the starting player card.
<br>
Ties: If 2 or more players are tied at the end
of round 2, then play a third round.
<br>
Round 3: This is the same as round 1, except
now the decoy card also counts during scoring.
Additional rounds: If there continue to be 
ties, play additional rounds under round 2 rules
but remove the highest number each time. This 
can make it so that a move is impossible 
because there are no available numbers to play 
a card on: in this case, immediately end the 
round.
