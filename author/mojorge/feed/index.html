That&#8217;s what makes Mantis Falls so unique- it takes this genre of betrayal games and fits it nicely into a 2-player experience (it plays up to 3 players with the expansion). Rules In Mantis Falls, players play as witnesses trying ... <a title="Mantis Falls, a 2-player game of Betrayal" class="read-more" href="https://jorgezhang.com/2020/06/mantis-falls-a-2-player-game-of-betrayal/" aria-label="More on Mantis Falls, a 2-player game of Betrayal">Read more</a>]]></description>
