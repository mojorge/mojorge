					<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed reading this review. It does sound the the meat is there with Dicit, but lots more details need to be fleshed out before it should be produced. I noticed that as of today, the designer has 3 days left on the Kickstarter and 50% funded. I hope he takes your group&#039;s advice and makes an even better game! 

I like the dice game Unearth, and I have heard that Artifacts, Inc. is great, too. Thanks for the great content, as always!]]></description>
