I was skeptical at first as well, until it became quickly clear that there was a lot more strategy than what met the eye once Isaac started wrecking the other players. We play together at a board game club at our university.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for the review, Jorge! I had never heard of this game before, and always love learning new games. At first glance this game seems too simple to be interesting--just playing as many cards as you can with a matching suit and either winning or losing. However, once you explained the need for planning ahead and making retreats, the game is more appealing. Great article! Do you and your friends get together and play at your local school? That is my guess based on the pictures.]]></description>
