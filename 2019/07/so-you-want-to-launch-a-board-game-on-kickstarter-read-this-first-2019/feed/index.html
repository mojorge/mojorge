Thanks for the thoughtful comments, Kevin! I probably spent around $1000-2000 so far on this project. I still want to pursue Daggers High, but the main issue would be the time investment now that I am about to be a full-time student again, so my thought was to try and get a publisher involved. I&#039;ll keep what you said in mind though.]]></description>

What&#039;s the total money you&#039;ve spent on this kick starter project, you never gave a final tally?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My suggestion is to refine the game with play testing and in reality you only needed to pay for art on those three cards shown, and truth be told a retheme with new art and one killer component rendered in graphics would be cheaper than what you&#039;ve already done. Jamey Steagmaier launched his first game with an 800 investment and raised $65k. I would encourage you to pursue the success of this game, even if that means you pick up a second job for a few weeks, mow some lawns walk some dogs etc...]]></description>

Agreed with everyone you&#039;ve said. Thanks for sharing! Definitely let me know about any games you plan to put on Kickstarter soon, I&#039;d love to hear about them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for taking the time to write this detailed review of your Kickstarter experience. I would say that although your project didn&#039;t fund this time, it was worth the experience for the wealth of knowledge you now have. I am also an aspiring game creator who has spent a lot of time researching Kickstarter and working on projects for that platform. I would definitely recommend reading Jamey Stegmaier&#039;s book &quot;A Crowdfunder&#039;s Strategy Guide&quot; several times before launching a project. I would add to what Jorge has written by saying that while running a Kickstarter project will cost money, you can mitigate many of the costs by a) including said costs in your funding goal so you can pay yourself back later, and b) spending lots of time beforehand building your community and promoting yourself to fellow gamers. As Richard Bliss says in his Kickstarter podcast, &quot;you don&#039;t have a funding problem, you have a CROWD problem.&quot; Thanks again, Jorge!]]></description>
