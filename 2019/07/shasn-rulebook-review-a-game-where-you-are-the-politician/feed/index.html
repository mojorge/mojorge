Great point about the FAQ&#039;s. I use them all the time when they come in the rulebook. Lots of great stuff to consider. Looks like Shasn is doing great on KS!]]></description>

Thank you for reading! I&#039;m with you- examples of gameplay and quick-start guides are super helpful. I also enjoy detailed component lists a lot. Especially when the game includes a deck of some kind, it is nice to have a card list and explanation of some strategy tips, rulings, or interesting facts about each card. A list of commonly asked questions is also nice to have.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed the rulebook review. You&#039;re right, that rulebook looks amazing! I think rulebooks are very underrated by new game designers because they can really make or break a game experience. I love seeing examples of gameplay and quick-start guides in rulebooks. What other elements do you really love to see in rulebooks? Thanks again for the great content!]]></description>
