Oh wow, I didn&#039;t know he has run 5 projects on Kickstarter already! Then I would also ask him why he thinks his first project was successful, and how his projects have changed over the years. Anyway, great stuff, Jorge!]]></description>

Good questions! They would have made great inclusions. Vincent has been to Kickstarter a few times now. I believe this is would be his 5th project. It would be interesting to hear about how he advertises his games and business, as well as any Kickstarter lessons he has.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This was a great interview. Thanks for sharing it, Jorge! It&#039;s always interesting to hear from game designers and about their journey. I would have asked him if this RPG book project is his first experience with Kickstarter, and what he has learned from launching a project on KS. I would also ask how he advertises his games and website so more people can learn about and play his games.]]></description>
