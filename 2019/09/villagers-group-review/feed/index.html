That&#039;s a great point- I agree that a good board game will generally have all three acts present. I could see a couple of board games falling outside of this definition somewhat (for example, an abstract games might not contain any elements from the first act). Our group would definitely play Villagers at another game night! It will be interesting to see if the game continues to hold up after many plays.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the review! I enjoyed reading the opinion of every member of your group. It is important that the excitement of a game builds until the end. I just read a book that says a good board game should have three acts: the first one that sets up the story of the game, the second act where each player has a strategy in mind and a path they are taking to victory, and a third act which is the push to victory or the endgame. Would you agree with that assessment? Also, would your group play Villagers again at another game night?]]></description>
