Thanks! I was thinking of using The Game Crafter. I like Drive Thru Cards a lot, but they only do cards unfortunately. I&#039;ve only used The Game Crafter to order some extra cubes funnily enough, and they were fast and packaged well. It&#039;s definitely on the expensive side, especially print on demand, so I would definitely have to look at ways to bring that cost down, potentially by cutting out mechanics or something like that.]]></description>

I like your spirit! If you have a fun game, don&#039;t give up on making it a reality. Which print on demand services are you considering? I have only looked at The Game Crafter. I used them to make a prototype of one of my games and was pleased. I noticed the option to put my game on their site for public sale, but it seemed a bit on the expensive side for the customer.]]></description>

Thanks Benjamin! I am glad you are enjoying the reviews. Daggers High unfortunately did not fund through Kickstarter, though I may be putting it up on a print on demand service depending on the costs.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Jorge! I&#039;m your newest subscriber and a fellow board game player and designer. Thank you for the game review! I like how short and simple your reviews are. To answer your question, I would not like to be the Pope. It seems like too much pressure and tradition, haha! I&#039;m going to go check out your project Daggers High on Kickstarter now.]]></description>
