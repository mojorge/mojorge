					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for contributing an awesome post, Liam! I agree with you a lot. I get the impression that those who are far removed from high school generally look down upon students who get Senioritis. I think that this is due to a lack of perspective. High school is a lot different from what it was like 20 to 30 years ago. I can safely say that college admissions have gotten insanely more competitive than they used to be. While this may not be everyone&#039;s experience, at least within the selective enrollment high schools, this competition has created a culture of perfection. AP classes are no longer an advantage, but an expectation. Anything less than an A is seen as failure. Many ask students to not participate in this culture. That&#039;s similar to asking a company to not be profitable: it has long lasting and real impacts on a student&#039;s future college prospects. I would argue that high school students are held hostage to this system of competition, and when that pressure is removed, it is no wonder to me that many choose to stop investing so much time into school. I would agree that we should be blaming the teachers rather than the students, as they control all of the incentives. This means that students cannot possibly be the agents for change in the broken college admission system. Rather, teachers should be looking into ways to create a system where students are willing participants rather than prisoners.]]></description>
