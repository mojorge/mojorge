Yeah that could be really funny actually! This is a great idea for an expansion, since I&#039;m imagining something like this would be card-based (as in, you get dealt parents at the start of the game) and ideally would be able to be added without changing the boards.]]></description>

Thanks Liam! Yeah, I&#039;m super grateful for the feedback. They probably didn&#039;t play any of the games since the turnaround time for the contest was just about 1 month; I think it was more of an impressions thing. Had I made it to the second round they would have had me ship a copy of the game to them.]]></description>

I agree with David–I think it&#039;s really cool to release judge feedback and directly address it. I do agree that some of the judge comments were a little unfounded; it&#039;s so strange that they didn&#039;t actually play the game, and a lot of their confusion definitely is a result of that. It sucks that you didn&#039;t qualify for the next round, but more feedback is always a good thing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Those comments seem really helpful. Releasing them is a very commendable choice on Cardboard Eddison&#039;s part! When I skimmed the other high school game you linked, I noticed that they incorporate parents. I think that it would be hilarious if the unique characteristic each player has was thematically based on their character&#039;s parents instead of their character. It would take some rejiggering, but I feel like there is a lot of thematic and comedic potential in having parents be a character&#039;s defining characteristic.]]></description>
