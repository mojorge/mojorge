<p>Hey everyone! I got a pretty good response to my first Shadow Era video, so I decided to make a couple more. I found that I actually really enjoyed making these videos, and so I wanted to share a bit of the process behind it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="DB Ythan Deck Overview Shadow Era 2019" width="825" height="464" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5QKttXoMR4Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption>A deck overview</figcaption></figure>



<p>The above video is a deck overview of the DB Ythan deck. In order to make this video, I used Quicktime Player to screen record and audio record at the same time. I then used iMovie to edit the video and added in music after the fact. I did that because recording my voice over the music made the voice track a lot more muddled.</p>



<p><strong>Script and editing:</strong> I did not write a script for this video. I thought I had done a pretty good job until I played it back to myself, and realized that about every 8 seconds I said &#8220;Um,&#8221; &#8220;Basically,&#8221; or &#8220;like.&#8221; I also repeated myself a lot and had several unnecessary sections. I realized that in its original form, the video was unwatchable. So, I decided to edit out the filler words like &#8220;um&#8221; rather than refilm it. This made editing a nightmare and it took several hours to complete! Had I spent more time preparing and being conscious of using too many filler words, it would have been a lot easier to make this video. It probably took 3-4 hours overall to make the video.</p>



<p>This made me more aware of my speech as well. After hearing the voice track repeated to me, I started to get used to my own voice which initially I was pretty uncomfortable with. I think it was a good practice to make this video so that I could really hear what it sounds like to talk to me, and hopefully improve my speech.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="DB Ythan - Games With Commentary Shadow Era 2019" width="825" height="464" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GFWNAMFwTEM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption>Gameplay overview</figcaption></figure>



<p>So this video is gameplay with commentary video, and it was actually really easy to make. I did the same process as the last video, but this time I was a lot more conscious of using filler words. I also was a lot more confident in talking to myself, which helped a lot with my speech. </p>



<p><strong>Script and Editing:</strong> I did not have a script for this video either, but I was really happy with the way it came out. I still had some speech issues with using too many filler words, but to a much lesser degree, so I decided not to edit out the &#8220;um&#8221;s in the video. I added in the music after the fact as well. Because I did not have to edit the video as much, this video was a lot faster to make. It probably took me 2 hours to make the video.</p>



<p>That being said, the upload time was insane, and it took about 2 or 3 hours to put it on Youtube. Compared to about an hour for the first video, it took a lot longer. It also made me run out of space on my computer, so I had to delete the videos from iMovie right after I finished.</p>



<p>Shadow Era is not the most popular game, so I don&#8217;t expect these videos to take off. That being said, I think it was helpful to make them for myself, as they really helped brush up my video editing and recording skills. I also would like to think that this would help me improvise speech and sound better. What did you think of the two videos? Any areas where I can improve even more? Anyone else make youtube videos that I should go watch? Let me know in the comments below. Thanks for reading! </p></div></div>
