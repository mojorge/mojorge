<p>Answer: Yes, yes I did. </p>



<p>I recently participated in a contest called the <g class="gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="5" data-gr-id="5">24 hour</g> Design contest. The rules are simple: you have 24 hours to design a tabletop game. Also, the game must include some element of &#8220;bureaucracy&#8221;. </p>



<p>Anyway, I have been kicking around this idea of a mechanic for exploring a dungeon for a while, and I wanted to try it out. So then I realized that instead of exploring a dungeon, I could take advantage of this contest and have the players explore an office! Unfortunately, that seemed really dull, and I felt that I needed to make something a little bit more interesting. I also needed there to be a reason that you are avoiding enemies, or in this case your employees.</p>



<figure><img src="images/1.png" alt="img" height=400 width=300><figcaption>Mr. Bean was the inspiration for this game.<br></figcaption></figure>



<p>That&#8217;s when I remembered what is perhaps my favorite Mr. Bean moment ever: he locks himself outside of his hotel room, and he&#8217;s naked. So he goes around the hotel hiding from the other guests, looking for clothes. It&#8217;s really funny, and exactly the kind of reason that you&#8217;d be hiding from your employees! </p>



<p>So the premise of the game is that you are a wealthy CEO, and you wake up naked for some unexplained reason. If you are the first player to collect all 4 pieces of clothing you win the game. Alternatively, each time you are caught by an employee you must bribe them with 1 million dollars of your salary. If you are the last player with a salary, you also win the game.</p>



<figure><img src="images/2.jpg" alt="img" height=300 width=400><figcaption>An example of a playtest of the game. I didn&#8217;t even bother printing half the cards or the tokens since honestly it would probably be a waste of ink. Luckily the game is super simple, so it was pretty easy to substitute the pieces, and use some of the original paper cards I made in the concept phase.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Anyway, I was surprised to find that I really enjoyed playing the game when I was playing it, mostly for the humor value. There is also some strategy going on here, which I was happy to see. There&#8217;s a ton of luck, but I think it&#8217;s a little bit forgivable considering the theme. That being said, there are a few pretty significant issues that I didn&#8217;t get to fix as the contest is only so long. Firstly, sometimes you can miss that a newly placed room contains a piece of clothing since you have to keep referencing the 4 clothing cards. Secondly, the game can drag on&#8230; especially if the right rooms are not being drawn. This is doubly bad since it takes up a ton of table space. Finally, there are some minor placement issues and some edge cases where it could be impossible to place a room. </p>



<p>Anyway, the contest voting is open right now, and I would really appreciate it if you checked it out! You can find the voting for the contest open on Board Game Geek here: <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/253686/24-hour-contest-february-2019">https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/253686/24-hour-contest-february-2019</a></p>



<p>Would you actually play this game, or is it terrible? Let me know in the comments, and thanks for reading!</p></div></div>
