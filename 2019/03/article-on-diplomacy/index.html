<p>Hey everyone! About a year ago I wrote up an article for the Diplomacy Pouch, and it was published some while ago! I basically completely forgot about it until now, but I thought I would share the article with you all. Check it out here:</p>



<p><a href="http://uk.diplom.org/pouch/Zine/F2018M/Zhang/study.html">http://uk.diplom.org/pouch/Zine/F2018M/Zhang/study.html</a></p>



<p>Anyway, it&#8217;s basically my high school AP Research <g class="gr_ gr_8 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="8" data-gr-id="8">paper,</g> but rewritten for people who are already familiar with Diplomacy. I&#8217;m not very proud of that paper, because I wrote most of it in the span of about 2 weeks even though I had well over six months to do it. I know that some of my classmates were in similar situations, but if I&#8217;m being honest with myself I probably should have worked harder in that class. Despite that, it&#8217;s still a pretty cool article and a short <g class="gr_ gr_9 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="9" data-gr-id="9">read,</g> and goes over some very interesting trends that were captured from the data of about 100 online games of Diplomacy. A lot of the trends, like &#8220;you are more likely to be stabbed if your opponent borders more of your supply centers&#8221; seem to be obvious truths, but it is nice to see that confirmed with data (and interesting that this seems to level off in some cases!).</p>



<p>I was inspired by this study, called the <a href="http://vene.ro/betrayal/niculae15betrayal.pdf">LINGUISTIC HARBINGERS OF BETRAYAL,</a> which is honestly fantastic. It showed that people are more vague, more optimistic, and more polite when they are just about to betray you. That&#8217;s freaking cool! I highly recommend the read if you are into that kind of stuff. Also, it&#8217;s even further confirmation that robots are going to be taking over our lives in the near future: robots could predict when someone was going to betray at a higher rate than humans on the basis of the linguistic cues alone. Woah!</p>



<p>What do you think of these studies? Let me know in the comments below, and thanks for reading!</p></div></div>
