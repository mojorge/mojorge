<p style="font-size:18px">Initially this article was a review that was fairly critical of the game, but I&#8217;ve since changed it to a preview. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s actually still being developed, and the creator is responding to feedback and making changes to the game. Because of that, I want to refrain from passing too many judgements on the game. It is on Kickstarter now, so if it sounds like something you would be interested in, this game can be found there! Unlike the title of this post suggests, no babies were punched in the process of making this post. </p>

<h2>How to play</h2>



<p style="font-size:18px">Punching Babies is a very simple 2 player game. It consists of 1 deck of cards, and each player draws 10 of these cards. Players then take turns playing cards until they both run out, and the player who took the least amount of damage wins. </p>



<p style="font-size:18px">While I didn&#8217;t actually try this, I feel like it would probably be very easy to play this game with 3 to 4 players. That way, even if one player draws a terrible hand, the players can balance the game between themselves. Perhaps there is a possibility of drafting or some other interesting mechanics? It isn&#8217;t mentioned in the rules, but something to experiment with. As <g class="gr_ gr_842 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="842" data-gr-id="842">an</g> example, I did try a house rule where players would draw 10 and discard down to 5, and it worked very well.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px">You will probably need a pencil and paper to keep track of damage, as it is difficult to track damage with the included components or through mentally keeping score.</p>



<h2>Fun Theme</h2>



<p style="font-size:18px">Part of why I decided to review this game is because of the unusual theme, and it didn&#8217;t disappoint. You can play cards like &#8220;Temper Tantrum&#8221; or &#8220;Crybaby,&#8221; which is honestly hilarious and gives the game a lighter tone. While the creator wanted to change the artwork, I actually prefer the simplistic style. If the kids were more detailed, I&#8217;d probably feel worse about beating them up.</p>



<figure><img src="images/2.jpg" alt="img" width=40%><figcaption>I really like the look of the cards</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Who would enjoy this game?</h2>



<p style="font-size:18px">Punching Babies is a great game for <s>child abusers</s> those who want a fast-paced card game that doesn&#8217;t take too much thinking. There were great moments where I drew just the right card to complete my combo, and others where I had the perfect counter move to a certain card. Keep in mind that the game is officially limited to 2 players, which I find odd since I think it would be possible to throw in a third player. The game length will generally be short, though there are so many cards that let you draw more cards that even playing with a house rule to draw 10 and then discard 5, it can be hard to predict when a game might end. In some ways, I&#8217;d liken it to a game like Uno, where you don&#8217;t have to think very hard about your moves, but there is still some strategy. That&#8217;s why I think this game would be very well suited for those looking for light, casual, fun.
