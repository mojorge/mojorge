<h1>A Weird Approach to a Solo Mode</h1>		

</header>


<p>May 1, 2023 by Jorge Zhang</p>

Turning a multiplayer board game into a solitaire game is difficult. That is because other players are often what provides the tension in games, and removing the players removes the tension. Without others to compete against, there is no pressure to make good decisions and no one else to satisfyingly defeat. A lot of solo modes solve this problem by emulating other players with an AI opponent. This AI opponent is often card-driven. Each turn, the player draws a card from the AI deck, and each card determines the decisions and actions of the AI. One example of this system is the solo mode in Dune Imperium. 
<br>
<br>
While I do like this solution a lot, there were two issues when it came to designing Chroma Mix's solo mode. Firstly, one thing I dislike about AI opponents is how the AI never really feels like an actual opponent. Unlike a person, a card-driven AI does not think. It does not strategize, plan, or make intelligent moves. To compensate for this lack of intelligence, an AI might not have to follow the rules and might start with extra resources, but they are still dumb. Secondly, I wanted to limit the number of cards in Chroma Mix to a reasonable number. I was worried about the manufacturing cost of the game, and so I needed a solo mode that didn't require an entire separate deck to adjudicate the AI's moves.
<br>
<br>
Thus, I settled on an unconventional approach- I would have the player make the AI's moves. This solves the first issue because suddenly, the AI is thinking. Secondly, it means that I would not need a separate deck to determine the moves of the AI. Of course, this creates further issues. The player has no incentive to play the AI's moves well. Secondly, it is quite difficult to play for 2 players at once as it means keeping track of 2 separate strategies. That's when I had the idea of having the player purposely sabotage the AI. This fixed the incentive issue, and arguably fixed the mental load issue as making bad moves is a lot easier than making good ones.
<br>
<br>
Ultimately, I was pretty satisfied with my approach to the solo mode in Chroma Mix. The concept is definitely a little bit out there (or if someone else has done it before, I've never encountered it), so I am not sure how well it will be received, but I do think this unconventional method could have applications for other games with similar constraints to mine. 
<br>
<br>
I did want to briefly mention a couple other approaches to solo design. If you don't go the route of an AI opponent, I think it is important to have a way to measure the success of the player. This could be a high score mechanism or loss conditions. Both of these create tension and give the player a reason to do well and make good decisions. These were both pretty poor fits for Chroma Mix because the multiplayer game has 3 win conditions and 0 loss conditions. Thus, victory points don't necessarily reflect the success of the player, and adding loss conditions would likely require additional components.
<br>
<br>
If you are interested in checking out Chroma Mix, you can find the game on Gamefound at <a href="https://gamefound.com/projects/jayzee-games/chroma-mix">https://gamefound.com/projects/jayzee-games/chroma-mix</a>. I am planning to launch on June 1st, and greatly appreciate pre-launch page follows. By following the game, you'll get updates on its development and also help boost the algorithm. Thank you for reading, and I hope to see you on the campaign page!
