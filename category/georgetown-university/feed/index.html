					<description><![CDATA[There are few beliefs that we (as a society) hold as sacredly as academic honesty. We pretend that cheating does not happen frequently, and that it is an unacceptable behavior. Yet, students are cheating all the time. The following study found that 68% of undergraduates cheated at some point in college: 68% percent is a ... <a title="An Easy Way to Permanently End Academic Dishonesty" class="read-more" href="https://jorgezhang.com/2020/05/an-easy-way-to-permanently-end-academic-dishonesty/" aria-label="More on An Easy Way to Permanently End Academic Dishonesty">Read more</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A few weeks ago, I outlined why I believe that grades need to be abolished. The main argument is that grades have alienated students from the real purpose of education. Rather than learn, students obey their teacher&#8217;s instructions as closely as possible to maximize their grade. Abolishing grades might actually make graduates more competitive: creative ... <a title="Narrative Evaluation to Replace Letter Grades" class="read-more" href="https://jorgezhang.com/2020/04/narrative-evaluation-to-replace-letter-grades/" aria-label="More on Narrative Evaluation to Replace Letter Grades">Read more</a>]]></description>

We have to consider equity- for disadvantaged students, students applying to graduate schools, and anyone who cannot participate in class to their full ability due to the extreme circumstances.
