<h2>CCG Reviews</h2>
<p>I have played a lot of CCGs and am always on the hunt to find more high quality ones to play. I wrote this to document my achievements in each game and write up a short commentary on which ones I liked/disliked. This specifically focuses on digital CCGs, but I talk about the physical versions if applicable.</p>

<h4>A note on monetization:</h4>
Every digital CCG is technically "free to play." The thing is, most of these games do not respect your time. They want you to log in every day to collect the bonuses and grind your way to a good deck. I hate this, because it's not fun, and it incentivizes playing only 1 deck. I personally believe that this defeats the point of CCGs because I want to be able to try out different decks and, well, deck build. I also don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a digital game when I could just spend that money buying a game on Steam. 


<h4>Shadow Era</h4>
This is my main CCG. I won the world championships in 2020 and have countless other top finishes in tournaments. I really like the mechanics in Shadow Era, and discuss it in more depth in a <a href="https://www.jorgezhang.com/2019/03/shadow-era-ccg-review1/index.html">blog post</a>. Moreover, the competitive scene is really fun and the community is great. It's pretty easy to grind a good deck, and monetization is very reasonable (I am completely free to play). I will admit though that it is not the most noob friendly because the solo mode/tutorial is garbage and there's not a lot of resources out there on how to make a good deck. I think that joining the community is vital to having a good experience.

<ol>
  <li>2018 Worlds top 16 finish</li>
  <li>2019 Worlds top 8 finish</li>
  <li>2020 World Champion</li>
</ol>

<h4>Yugioh (Master Duel)</h4>
This was my first CCG. I used to make popular YouTube videos to showcase my replays. Honestly, for me Yugioh is great nostalgia and I like how the game kind of feels like a puzzle. It's so unique because of the lack of a mana curve. The monetization of the physical game and digital games is generally horrible though. In Duel Links I made it to King of Games several times. Master Duel is lots of fun and you can make a single top tier deck for free.

  <li>Plat 1 on Master Duel (as of this writing, the top rank).</li>
</ol>

<h4>Hearthstone</h4>
For a few months in 2020, I played a lot of Hearthstone. I made it all the way to legend, and wrote about my experiences in a <a href="https://www.jorgezhang.com/2020/05/hearthstone-may-2020-complete-beginners-guide-to-getting-legend/index.html">blog post</a>. I quit because I could tell that I would never be able to keep up with the set rotations and stay competitive without investing lots of money and time.

<h4>Legends of Runeterra</h4>
I played this game quite a bit and made it to master rank. It's really easy to make decks in this game, and I really appreciated this. I made a bunch of for fun decks and had a good time.

<h4>Magic The Gathering (Arena)</h4>
MTG is ok. I love how unique the card design is, but don't love the monetization of the game. I felt like Arena made it too difficult to make even 1 top tier deck for free. I enjoyed playing the structure decks they provide you casually, but didn't do much else.

<h4>Faeria</h4>
I think Faeria is the best CCG mechanically on this list. That's because it actually takes advantage of the position of cards on the board, and the strategy is especially deep. I also really like the business model of buying the game up front. It's like 15 dollars to buy the game, and it is well worth it to me. While it is super easy to obtain cards, I do feel like they should give you everything up front though. 


<h4>Other CCGs that I have tried before</h4>
I don't have strong opinions on these yet.
<ol>
  <li>Gwent: sort of disliked it, but also barely played past the tutorial.</li>
  <li>Eternal: it's an MTG clone but it can be entertaining and a bit more f2p friendly. Overall a decent game.</li>
  <li>The Elder Scrolls Legends: I sort of liked it for the story campaign mode, but eventually got bored because it was taking too long to grind a good deck and hop into pvp.</li>
  <li>Animation Throwdown: This is a gacha game in disguise.</li>
  <li>Stormbound: I hate that you have to grind upgrades for cards. Such a shame since this game is great mechanically.</li>
  <li>Cards, The Universe, and Everything: I am super impressed by the trading system where you can just trade your way to a strong deck. The game is too simple for my taste but can be good for when I don't want to think too much.</li>

</ol>
