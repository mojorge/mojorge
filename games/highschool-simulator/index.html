<h1>Highschool Simulator</h1>
<p>This game is a digitalized version of Daggers High, a board game I made about the competitive college admissions process. A few things were changed for the digital adaption, but the rules are largely the same. </p>

<p>Notes on gameplay: The goal is to obtain as many resume points as possible. These can be obtained through various means, including but not limited to: getting A's, leading clubs, and getting teacher rec letters. To achieve these things, you will have to go to school, upon which a random event will occur. By going to school, you will be able to accumulate resources that are needed to make progress in the game. Any button shaded in dark grey is locked and cannot be used: perhaps you don't have enough resources. Anything button shaded in dark green is locked as well because you have already gotten it. Be careful: if you get less than 10 hours of sleep per night, you will get +1 stress for each less sleep at the end of the year. You also get +1 stress per 2 happiness lost, rounded down. Getting to 10 stress results in a mental breakdown, costing resume points and permanent sleep.</p>
