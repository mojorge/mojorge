<h1>The Economics of Opening a Yugioh Case</h1>		

</header>


<p>August 8, 2022 by Jorge Zhang</p>


<br>
<b>Introduction:</b> A Yugioh case is 12 boxes (288 packs). Is it worth buying a case? In this article, I go over the theoretical value of opening a case of Power of the Elements if you were to sell everything, and then document my experience actually buying one.



<h3>Costs</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>The case: $745.</b> If you own a physical store or buy many months in advance, this cost can go down. It does not decrease much for buying multiple cases: I got quoted a price of 742.45 for buying 2 or more cases. If you get a resale sales tax exemption letter (you should if you plan to resell the cards), you do not pay sales tax. </li>
<li><b>TCGplayer Cut: 12.75% + $0.30.</b> You have to sell the cards somewhere, and in my opinion the best place for that is <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/">TCGplayer.com</a>. You can use Ebay, but you'll need to spend more work on the listings (taking photos, typing up the description, etc.). You could use a different site, but those get less traffic (The 12.75% + $0.30 includes the credit card fee of 2.5% + .30). </li>
<li><b>Card sleeves: $.01 per sleeve.</b> You should be able to get card sleeves for pretty cheap. </li>
<li><b>Toploaders: $.20 per Toploader OR $0 for cardboard.</b> I do not think it is worth buying Toploaders right now, even when you buy them in bulk. That is because there is a Toploader shortage right now, and it just is too expensive. I found that using sturdy cardboard cut from cardboard boxes works well at protecting the cards. </li>
<li><b>Envelopes/bubble mailer: $.03 per Envelope OR $.22 for a padded envelope.</b> Normal envelopes work fine, but sometimes you need to use a bubble mailer (explained in the next section)</li>
<li><b>Shipping: $.60 per stamp (no tracking) OR ~$4 for first class USPS with tracking.</b> Any transactions over $50 require shipping with tracking, which you can only do with a bubble mailer.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Revenue</h3>
Every case will have 24 secret rares, 48 ultra rares, and 216 super cares. You get a lot of commons, but they are generally not worth selling.

<li><b>Secret Rares in POTE based on values on 8/6/22: $619.46 ($499.68 after costs).</b> This is calculated by taking the average number of each secret rare pulled (2.4) and multiplying it by the market price as listed on TCGplayer. I am aware that these prices have and will change, but they work for the purpose of an estimate.
  <ol> 
    <li>Ashura King: $1.88</li>
    <li>Draco-Utopian Aura: $3.00</li>
    <li>Exosister Martha:	$21.67</li>
    <li>Ghoti of the Deep Beyond: $2.56</li>
    <li>Instant Contact: $6.41</li>
    <li>Kurikara Divincarnate: $12.47</li>
    <li>Primeval Planet Perlereino: $67.14</li>
    <li>Spright Blue: $82.76</li>
    <li>Tearlaments Kaleido-Heart: $11.25</li>
    <li>Ultimate Slayer: $48.97</li>
  </ol>
</li>
<li><b>Ultra Cares: $273.29 ($195.25 after costs)</b> I'm not going to list these prices. </li>
<li><b>Super Rares: Hard to calculate. </b> Most super cares are going to sell for less than $1, and that is the point that you have to wonder whether they are even worth listing. Making revenues from selling super rares is highly dependent on whether you can sell multiple cards at once.</li>
<li><b>Starlight Rare: $150. </b> This is calculated by the value of a starlight rare (roughly $300) times the chance of getting one (50%).</li>
<li><b>1% on credit card purchases: $7.45. </b> If you buy your case with a credit card, you can get some of it back in the form of credit card rewards.</li>
<li><b>Overall: $1,042.76 ($844.93 after costs).</b> </li>
</ol>

<h3>What's the catch?</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Opportunity cost: </b> It takes a long time to organize the cards, list everything online, mail stuff out, and more. Ultimately, working a minimum wage job is probably best. </li>
<li><b>Cards do not hold their value: </b> Over time, card prices will generally fall as more cases get opened, and reprints eventually occur. You need to sell your cards very quickly.</li>
<li><b>Luck: </b> Pulling highly valued secret rares and the starlight rare make up the bulk of the value of the case. </li>
</ol>

<h3>My case</h3>
I brought a case and here is what I pulled:

</figure>
<br>
So yeah, I didn't pull any starlight rates, and on top of that, one of my boxes only had 1 secret rare. Sadly, there is nothing I can really do about the missing secret rare because Konami does not technically guarantee the ratios in each box. I also thought that a lot of the commons were off center or damaged, despite me being careful when opening the packs. So the quality control is not the best. With what I pulled, I am expecting to take a loss of about $50 overall. I will have to update you all later on whether I actually break even or not (I am planning to sell everything except for the Venusylphs because I like the archetype and they aren't selling for much anyway). So far, I have sold $379.

</figure>
<figure>
  <img src="pdf/packing3.jpeg" alt="pack 1" width="300" height="175">
  <figcaption>I then put it in an envelope, or in this case in a bubble mailer with more cardboard protection. I also threw in my game, <a href="https://www.jorgezhang.com/2021/12/cant-touch-this/index.html">Can't Touch This</a>, into the package, as a bonus gift.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Overall</h3>
It was actually a ton of fun to open up all the packs and sort through them. Even though I did not get very lucky and will probably lose money overall, I don't regret buying a case.
