			<p>Every game designer has a favourite board game, so I thought I&#8217;d talk about mine today! Mine is Diplomacy, a game involving seven players trying to take control of Europe. Here is a map of the game:</p>

<p>The rules are pretty simple, so I&#8217;ll give a brief overview for those unfamiliar. The goal of the game is to take 18 supply centers, which is one more than half of them. Everyone starts with 3 or 4 Supply centers, and gains more through taking them from other players (or taking a neutral one). Players get as many units as supply centers, and can gain units by getting more (conversely, can lose units by losing supply centers). Every turn, the players write down a move for each unit on a piece of paper, and then the moves all happen at the same time.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s basically it. There aren&#8217;t any dice, or cards. The meat of the game is all in negotiating with the other players to try and get them to do what you want.</p>
<p>I think that the game is so well designed that I started a club for it in high school. I&#8217;ve traveled to and played in tournaments for the game, and played countless online games as well. So, why do I like this game so much? Simply, it&#8217;s just really fun. I could go on for a long time about Diplomacy, but there&#8217;s three main things that I think put Diplomacy in a league of it&#8217;s own in terms of well designed games.</p>
<ol>
<li>Tons of conflict</li>
<li>Real time</li>
<li>Limitless skill- and limitless replayability</li>
</ol>
<p>All games need conflict. In Diplomacy, there is more conflict than in any other game I&#8217;ve played because you have seven people with different motives and goals. Everyone <em>needs</em> other people to work with them in order to make progress. On the other hand, in order to win the game you have to hurt others and even the people you work with. That&#8217;s why Diplomacy is known as a game of backstabbing and deception. I&#8217;m pretty sure the designer did not intend it to be that way: I think there is just so much conflict that players often times have no choice but to lie in order to make progress. A quick note, conflict is not necessarily player to player conflict. A good example is Pandemic, where the players team up to fight against the game itself to contain a plague. But a game without conflict does not exist because then there is nothing to be invested in and no meaningful choices to make.</p>
<p>Lots of games are held back by long turns of waiting for others to make a decision. It&#8217;s often times a necessary evil in games just because as the decisions become more meaningful, the time it takes to make them increases. However, in Diplomacy, there is no &#8220;down time&#8221; because everyone is playing at the same time. This is why while the game can take 7 (or more!) hours to complete, it goes by extremely quickly. You just get so into it and never disconnect since there is always someone to talk to, someone to try and convince, or orders to write.</p>
<p>Finally, Diplomacy has truly unlimited replayability because of the fact that negotiation is a skill that can be honed indefinitely. Even without negotiation, the number of possibilities in terms of sheer moves rivals chess. There are a lot of games like this, but I have never gotten tired of Diplomacy while I get bored of other board games after playing them too much.</p>
<p>There are issues with Diplomacy, such as the fact that it is very difficult to get a game going, and the fact that being eliminated kind of sucks. But overall, for me it is head and shoulders above any other game I&#8217;ve played. If you have played Diplomacy before, or have something else to say, leave a comment below!
