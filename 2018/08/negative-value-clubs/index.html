			<p>Hi everyone! Continuing our club series is the three negative valued clubs. Despite making you lose Resume Points for owning them, they come with powerful effects and are relatively cheap to obtain. I also think these are some of the funniest clubs in the game, which is a big plus.</p>

<p>Poker used to be undoubtably the worst club in the game at -3 RP and a yearly effect of +2 Stress. It has been buffed since then to be in line with the other negative value clubs, and also grants Friends at the end of every year to make up for a pretty crappy yearly effect. Gaining stress at the end of the year is pretty bad because it leaves one vulnerable to an attack in the next year, and risks a breakdown. However, in Poker&#8217;s case, it could be worth it to give a needed boost to a player&#8217;s Friend economy, or immediately gain some math stats for a class.</p>

<p>This is one of my favorite clubs to get because it is a steroid club that immediately gives you 6 Friends in exchange for making it really hard to stockpile them in the future. The yearly isn&#8217;t as bad as it seems because you can choose the order of effects so that it doesn&#8217;t interfere with gaining friends through other clubs. Still, it is something to think about before picking this club up Freshman/Sophomore year. I think this card is almost always worth it Junior and Senior year since you can minimize the damage from the yearly effect and the -1 RP is not that bad considering that 6 Friends can usually make that back up.</p>

<p>This club is another &#8220;steroid&#8221; club that is basically free to pick up, and gives a lot of Happiness to boot. You need to own it to use one of the Essay cards, which is pretty cool. I also like how it seems naturally balanced: while it is better to get Junior or Senior year, Happiness tends to be worth less towards the end of the game. I also like this card thematically. It is pretty outrageous to have a club dedicated to your fans, which is what makes this hilarious to buy.</p>
