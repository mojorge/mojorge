			<p>Hey everybody! I have some new balance changes and text clarifications for you. Let&#8217;s dive right in!</p>

<img src="images/1.png" alt="poker" width=300 height=400>
<img src="images/2.png" alt="poker" width=300 height=400>


<p>Popular gets a much needed buff here, going from a continuous effect to something more similar to Summer Programs. In the past, players rarely grabbed Popular, and even if they did it rarely was a good investment. It also was never a good choice to pick up Junior year, and overall was a terrible card. I think the real issue is that friends now are significantly better than friends later because of the engine building aspect of club cards. Hopefully, this change makes Popular more competitive.</p>

<img src="images/4.png" alt="poker" width=300 height=400>


<p>Hide Homework is one of those cards that got an inadvertent buff from perfect grade bonuses. Due to perfect grade bonuses, this card allowed a player to completely ruin another player&#8217;s investment into their classes. This change is very small, but it now allows players to get an A in a class through other methods, such as cheating. This way, it isn&#8217;t as oppressive as it used to be.</p>

<img src="images/5.png" alt="poker" width=300 height=400>
<img src="images/6.png" alt="poker" width=300 height=400>

<p>The effect of Shadow Students has never been successfully pulled off before. Let that sink in. It&#8217;s an enticing card, but it is just too unrealistic to have straight A&#8217;s in 3 rounds. I&#8217;m sure that it is theoretically possible, but the conditions were definitely too strict. My hope is that this card will now be a more interesting decision as it will be a lot easier to get 3 A&#8217;s than 4 A&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<img src="images/7.png" alt="poker" width=300 height=400>
<img src="images/8.png" alt="poker" width=300 height=400>


<p>I&#8217;m trying to remove all of the cards that use the word &#8220;give&#8221;, as it just becomes really confusing and is kind of unnecessary. In a lot of playtests, players have been giving eachother their cubes and were unsure on whether they should still get friends even if another player had no friends. Thus, this change.</p>

<img src="images/9.png" alt="poker" width=300 height=400>
<img src="images/10.png" alt="poker" width=300 height=400>


<p>It was not very clear that if you chose not to do the choose effect, you would not lose the Integrity.</p>

<img src="images/11.png" alt="poker" width=300 height=400>
<img src="images/12.png" alt="poker" width=300 height=400>


<p>Similar change.</p>

<img src="images/13.png" alt="poker" width=300 height=400>
<img src="images/14.png" alt="poker" width=300 height=400>


<p>Similar to Talent Show, Monopolize Lunch Table&#8217;s &#8220;Take&#8221; was unclear. I also like this effect more as it somewhat shifts the dynamic of Freshman year from avoiding stocking up friends to stocking up some- for Stud Gov Pres and now this card as well.</p>
