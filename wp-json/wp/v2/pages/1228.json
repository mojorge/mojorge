See if you can solve this problem, and then check out the video explanation:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Five pirates (in order of seniority A, B, C, D and E) have found 100 gold coins. They must decide how to distribute them. The most senior pirate, pirate A, proposes a distribution which is either accepted or rejected by a vote (including the proposer. Ties mean that the distribution is accepted). If the plan is rejected, the proposer is thrown overboard and dies, and the next most senior pirate makes a new proposal to begin the system again. The process repeats until a plan is accepted or if there is one pirate left.<sup> <\/sup>Pirates base their decisions on four factors. First of all, each pirate wants to survive. Second, given survival, each pirate wants to maximize the number of gold coins he receives. Third, each pirate would prefer to throw another overboard, if all other results would otherwise be equal. And finally, the pirates do not trust each other, and will neither make nor honor any promises between pirates apart from a proposed distribution plan that gives a whole number of gold coins to each pirate. What is pirate A\u2019s proposed distribution plan?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https:\/\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Pirate-Problem.mp4\"><\/video><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Contact me at jorge@jorgezhang.com for more information. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Over the past 2 years, I have tutored over 13 students across dozens of subjects.
