Over the iterations it has been changed considerably, but the main idea of trading Integrity for an A has remained the same. It also turns out that hacking into gradebook to change grades isn&#8217;t too far off from reality as it has apparently happened before. Anyway, this club used to cost 5 Friends and give 1 RP, but I ended up changing it to match the rest of the clubs in the series. While it was fine at 5 Friends, I think it works well as a cheaper club as this way it can be obtained for just a couple of socialize actions. It has a lot of utility as a club to get in order to complete the perfect club requirement, or an essay. However, because of the 2 Integrity cost, it isn&#8217;t a great club otherwise as only some of the science classes can offset that loss.<\/p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"816\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/jorgezhang.com\/2018\/08\/zero-value-chill-clubs\/tv-and-film-appreciation\/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/TV-and-Film-Appreciation.png?fit=1000%2C1401&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1000,1401\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"TV and Film Appreciation\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/TV-and-Film-Appreciation.png?fit=214%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/TV-and-Film-Appreciation.png?fit=731%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-816 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/TV-and-Film-Appreciation.png?resize=305%2C427&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"305\" height=\"427\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/TV-and-Film-Appreciation.png?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/TV-and-Film-Appreciation.png?resize=214%2C300&amp;ssl=1 214w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/TV-and-Film-Appreciation.png?resize=768%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/TV-and-Film-Appreciation.png?resize=731%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 731w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>TV and Film Appreciation is a History Stat engine. It&#8217;s cheap at 3 Friends, and pays itself back at the end of the year. It&#8217;s also not worth any Resume Points. The idea for this club was based off of a few of the clubs at my school where people would just watch movies.

The club reflects that, but also gives back Happiness at the end of each year. This is actually very relevant since not only can this club be good damage control to prevent a breakdown, but it also makes it more difficult to break-down in the future due to lower happiness penalties. Although it isn&#8217;t worth any RP, it can help prevent a -5 RP Detention, which is a solid trade-off.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What do you think of these clubs, despite the fact that they are worth 0 RP?
