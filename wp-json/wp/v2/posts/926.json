Since I haven&#8217;t made any games before, I don&#8217;t have a pre-built community that I can rely on to promote the game. I also don&#8217;t have great access to board game conventions where you might take a game to promote it. Thus, one of my goals is to build as much of an online presence as I can before launching so that I can bring in as many backers from outside of Kickstarter as possible.
