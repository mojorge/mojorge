Today will be a short post to go over a recent play test. The whole play test took a bit over 2 hours (I have it written down as 2 hours 44 minutes, but there was a meal break in between) for 3 players. 2 of the players were new, while 1 had played the game several times before. The experienced player ran away with the game, ending with about 60 RP. The others trailed behind him by a bit. I actually thought this was a good thing, since it is an indication that playing the game well requires skill. It is also anecdotal evidence of my theory that teenagers are generally better at the game than adults :).<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">After the game though, one of the players remarked that they could have devoted resources towards fighting over clubs instead of getting A&#8217;s, and might have been able to catch up with the leader. Thus, this was the play test before a couple of the changes I have already talked about, such as perfect grade bonuses and changes to make club recursion more difficult. I also changed a few event cards ,such as Adderall on the FUN and Offensive Social Media Post. Overall, it was a very useful play test and created a lot of good changes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Thanks for reading, and let me know what you think in the comments!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"SzDcob\" src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/jtkD8McueFo7XbYMWGZsPrxnD92f1hL17IpP4NoBEBhuweUq4yZArFb1DhRDEzZMQHoDI9BWFcaUP0kyNADb_yXffkjTEzSyMVyFwdbsZ8uK-Z_9gV9gF-nsld1JwRdwhfoPUABz329_AblXTkSoW8Y0wh9hPUm4RUG3CKZlRlZ4i6sIYRq6tN2T6_d8EfZosftIfsU-RmfcBaAonjFn7gg5r_aPaMCrGPk8VQRetoER6i_dZkXpTT5EmYg8FYKDYzgr3JCjW_woZDMnyogirU3Ot4c2eg8CEdBFsL4GVqpwdKAG-7gCel8dRU2TGiHM_W7IVrqXg33zO-mZRpxEP_RNjaThcCfF4ygFVAlYyzJJMa5LzAopUlaZGGQLyukjmD1yLjaJ8_k1ER7682qDsKVmT45DeGOUk8O0r_4aro2DD460C_7SY9wAM99o9QjkWFbws5Ei8WHd3HcK5RvC2yws7pIw7fzL3ow2ljASt99M75DRorYAR4_O-BV88vn7gm0GibMsPR1YguPZMouOFidkZ4vUlCkM8oDa2y_FDkDEaPAGuKO1NJdzYLvbv6UiJVy9XE0KaQ0cBAlnPDGqbkyKJBy6nCSdUo5dGsgJ89MMjmnhyinupJ5DAlZRTtM=w1071-h803-no\" width=\"1071\" height=\"803\" aria-label=\"Photo - Landscape - Aug 19, 2018, 6:26:14 PM\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hey everyone!
