It also means that people will start posting more creative photos. On the other hand, it may make it harder for quality accounts to stand out from the rest of the crowd. A photo getting a lot of likes serves as a signal of popularity: thus, removing likes removes the ability for an account to show off how popular they are. For this reason, I think that <strong>Instagram&#8217;s change is great for personal accounts, and terrible for business accounts<\/strong>. A business wants to promote their products and reach as many people as possible- without likes, they have one less tool that can be used to show value in their products. On the other hand, individuals can have greater freedom to post the content that they want to post.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am not sure what prompted Instagram to make this change. My suspicion is that it won&#8217;t be good for Instagram in the long run. Instagram makes money from ads- and by hurting business accounts, some businesses may not buy as many ads as they normally would. One possible solution Instagram could try in order to get the best of both worlds is to let the user decide whether their likes are public or not. This would give individuals the freedom to have a more creative account without the pressure of creating content that will get a lot of likes. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you think of Instagram&#8217;s removal of visible likes?
