It was actually pretty fun, but there were some practical difficulties. Because there were only 8 teachers, teacher recs became a lot more competitive (I actually think this was a good thing). Also, clubs and essay cards ran out quickly and so it was also increasingly important to flip Essays. The game was not actually that long. We didn&#8217;t time the game, but it went under 2 hours I believe with all of the players being experienced with the game. The five-player variant was also pretty balanced and felt on par with the other player counts. All this being said, I wrote in a previous post that I planned on scrapping the five-player variant. In this instance, I felt like the cost was prohibitively high for the reward. I&#8217;ve almost never had exactly five people around to play the game with- but adding in an extra set of pieces as well as an additional player board would increase the overall price of the game by a non-insignificant sum.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, if you really wanted to play a five-player game, you could always buy a second copy.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In other news, an ad for Daggers High is featured in the Town Crier! The Town Crier is a space to promote board games, and so I am very glad that they were able to feature mine.
