In order to prepare for an upcoming kickstarter for Daggers High, I decided to start a company. I&#8217;m happy to announce Gordian Knot Games LLC! The name is inspired on a puzzle that I 3D printed with my high school&#8217;s 3D printer. I was really into 3D printing puzzles during my time there, and while I made a lot of memorable ones, my favorite was the Gordian Knot. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gordian Knot is a puzzle made out of six pieces- and the goal is to put them together and take them apart. While this task is easy to state, it is very difficult to solve. When I first attempted to solve the Gordian Knot, I spent several hours and felt like I was pretty close to the solution. In the end, I couldn&#8217;t solve it and had to look up the solution online. Seeing the solution made me realize that I was no where near close! I think this is a good metaphor for the games that I&#8217;d ideally like to make. They&#8217;re easy to learn- but difficult to solve or master.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1054\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/jorgezhang.com\/2018\/12\/gordian-knot-games-llc\/img_20181010_215744\/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/IMG_20181010_215744.jpg?fit=3456%2C4608&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3456,4608\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;LEX727&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1539208664&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;4.04&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;354&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.033333333333333&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"IMG_20181010_215744\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/IMG_20181010_215744.jpg?fit=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/IMG_20181010_215744.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"3456\" height=\"4608\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/IMG_20181010_215744.jpg?fit=768%2C1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1054\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/IMG_20181010_215744.jpg?w=3456&amp;ssl=1 3456w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/IMG_20181010_215744.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/IMG_20181010_215744.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/IMG_20181010_215744.jpg?w=2400&amp;ssl=1 2400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><figcaption>A picture of the Gordian Knot puzzle<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to try to solve the Gordian Knot yourself, you can 3D print one through this link:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.thingiverse.com\/thing:11204\">https:\/\/www.thingiverse.com\/thing:11204<\/a>.
