I think that it is possible that it could be worked on in the future, since our playtesters have enjoyed the game a lot. It definitely is not finished since it is missing a non-generic theme and artwork, and there probably are balance issues to be worked out. That being said, if you would like to print a copy for yourself and play it, I&#8217;d love to hear about it! Take a look below if you are interested.

The pdfs are 2 pages each because these cards are meant to be double sided. The pngs are one-sided. The number in front of each card is the number of times that it should be printed. For example, 14 Grass means that you should print that file 14 times. Files without a number just have to be printed once. We printed all the cards out with 3.5 inches X 2.5 inches, or standard poker card size. I think that the cards could be difficult to print for individuals because this was the format that the company that printed the cards wanted them in- probably because they have some kind of special program that can easily do it. I am guessing that these cards might have to be rearranged in a file similar to how the role cards are.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hello everyone!
