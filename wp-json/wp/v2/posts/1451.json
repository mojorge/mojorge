I try to avoid this as much as possible but just wanted to give you a heads up in case it happens again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a post contains an error, I will generally edit it. However, there are times when it makes more sense to unpublish a post. For example, sometimes I accidentally publish a post too early, and it is not finished. Also, in the case of reviews or previews, the designer may request that I withhold publishing a review before a certain date or time. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there are other times where it can be a tricky ethical question. I have begun reviewing board games, whether they are sent to me or if I am asked to review a digital PDF or file. I think it&#8217;s important to recognize the publisher&#8217;s point of view. They spend money, time, and energy to send me a product in the hopes that I&#8217;ll review it highly. While I can&#8217;t guarantee that I will like a game, I do my best to portray each game in a good light. That being said, what if this is not possible? Formerly, my plan was to simply publish a negative or lukewarm review. That being said, I don&#8217;t think this is the best option as it forces me to write about a game I kind of dislike, doesn&#8217;t service the publisher, and also isn&#8217;t super helpful for people looking for information on a new game they might want to consider getting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another very valid concern is the fact that I generally test the games I review by playing solo, even in a game intended for multiple players. I get around this by writing Rulebook Reviews, which don&#8217;t focus the gameplay but how well the rules explain the game. This is also much easier and faster for me than getting together a bunch of friends, and is what allows me to write reviews in a short period of time. I faced a bit of criticism recently for this when I made the mistake of writing a review for a game intended for multiple players without having played the game with another person. Reflectively, this was a mistake, as the game experience would be crappier and thus introduce a lot of bias into my review. A preview or rulebook review in those cases would be more appropriate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I already do this, but I plan to only request games that I anticipate myself enjoying. If I receive a game and don&#8217;t enjoy it, I&#8217;ll let the publisher know in advance and offer them the choice between not having a review be put up, or having a potentially negative review be posted. These cases represent a time loss for me and a loss for the publisher that sent me the game but are generally rare, as I enjoy most games.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, in case it isn&#8217;t clear, I haven&#8217;t unpublished any negative reviews yet. In the past, it&#8217;s always been because I made a mistake by publishing a post too early. That being said, as I start reviewing more games, I think this may become a larger problem, and something I&#8217;ll need to have a clear policy on going forward.
