Also made a post on BGG: https:\/\/boardgamegeek.com\/thread\/2156196\/lords-color-1-3-players<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey everyone! Today I am bringing you the Print and Play for Lord of Colors. You can print it at home and play it yourself! If you plan to, please let me know. I would love to chat about the game and talk about it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, there are a few things that make Lord of Colors unique. Firstly, it features a lot of engine building with a twist. A lot of engine builders can become a huge list of symbols and cards to keep track of that constantly need counting and attending to. Lord of Colors circumvents that with the Combining Colors feature, which allows players to take 2 weak cards and make 1 bigger card. That way, you are keeping track of a lot less stuff at once!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, actions have to be bid on. This means that there is an additional layer of strategy as you have to choose which actions are really important and bid highly on those actions in the hopes that you will get to use it. It also allows for a healthy amount of player interaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, it is a cool game about mixing and making colors. So check it out, and let me know what you think!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-file\"><a href=\"https:\/\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Lords-of-Color-Rulebook.pdf\">Lord of Colors Rulebook<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Lords-of-Color-Rulebook.pdf\" class=\"wp-block-file__button\" download>Download<\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-file\"><a href=\"https:\/\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Lords-of-Color-PNP.zip\">Lord of Colors PNP<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Lords-of-Color-PNP.zip\" class=\"wp-block-file__button\" download>Download<\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>I played it against myself (me playing as all 3 players) and it looked like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1165\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/jorgezhang.com\/2019\/02\/lords-of-color-pnp\/img_20190222_204221\/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/IMG_20190222_204221.jpg?fit=4000%2C3000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4000,3000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.2&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Mi A2 Lite&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1550868141&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;3.82&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.033333333333333&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"IMG_20190222_204221\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/IMG_20190222_204221.jpg?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/IMG_20190222_204221.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"4000\" height=\"3000\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/IMG_20190222_204221.jpg?fit=640%2C480\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1165\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/IMG_20190222_204221.jpg?w=4000&amp;ssl=1 4000w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/IMG_20190222_204221.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/IMG_20190222_204221.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/IMG_20190222_204221.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/IMG_20190222_204221.jpg?resize=1800%2C1350&amp;ssl=1 1800w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/IMG_20190222_204221.jpg?resize=576%2C432&amp;ssl=1 576w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/IMG_20190222_204221.jpg?w=2400&amp;ssl=1 2400w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/IMG_20190222_204221.jpg?w=3600&amp;ssl=1 3600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><figcaption>Lots of stuff going on!<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, what does this all mean for Daggers High? Daggers High is still the primary game that I am working on, and this was mostly just for fun. But since I have sent Daggers High all around the US (it is currently being evaluated by 7 different reviewers and the Cardboard Edison judges), I&#8217;ve had a lot more time to work on projects like this. What do you think of Print and Play games? Would you ever consider spending the time to print out and make a game?
