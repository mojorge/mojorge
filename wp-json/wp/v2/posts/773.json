Just wanted to share with you thoughts on the two player version of Dagers High. This was the first time in a couple of months that I tried the two player variant, and it ended up working very smoothly! I ended up losing to my friend who played it with me due to an early break down and poor management. Overall though, it was fairly close for most of the game and a lot of fun!<\/p>\n<p>A couple of thoughts. Firstly, it is almost exclusively better to buy a club from the other player rather than get a new club. Secondly, the bullying cards in the influence card deck were mostly must-have purchases since it hurt the other player a lot. Finally, a draft doesn&#8217;t work because then you have basically complete knowledge of what the other player has.<\/p>\n<p>So, to solve these issues, buying clubs from other players costs 2 extra friends. In addition, 4 bullying cards from the influence deck have been temporarily removed. I will have to determine at some point whether I will completely remove them, add them to some kind of expansion\/stretch goal, or keep them in the influence deck. Finally, in a two player game players draw 6 event cards and discard 2 instead of drafting.<\/p>\n<p>What do you think about these changes?
