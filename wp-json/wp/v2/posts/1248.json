About a year ago I wrote up an article for the Diplomacy Pouch, and it was published some while ago!

I&#8217;m not very proud of that paper, because I wrote most of it in the span of about 2 weeks even though I had well over six months to do it. I know that some of my classmates were in similar situations, but if I&#8217;m being honest with myself I probably should have worked harder in that class. Despite that, it&#8217;s still a pretty cool article and a short <g class=\"gr_ gr_9 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"9\" data-gr-id=\"9\">read,<\/g> and goes over some very interesting trends that were captured from the data of about 100 online games of Diplomacy. A lot of the trends, like &#8220;you are more likely to be stabbed if your opponent borders more of your supply centers&#8221; seem to be obvious truths, but it is nice to see that confirmed with data (and interesting that this seems to level off in some cases!).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was inspired by this study, called the <a href=\"http:\/\/vene.ro\/betrayal\/niculae15betrayal.pdf\">LINGUISTIC HARBINGERS OF BETRAYAL,<\/a> which is honestly fantastic. It showed that people are more vague, more optimistic, and more polite when they are just about to betray you. That&#8217;s freaking cool! I highly recommend the read if you are into that kind of stuff. Also, it&#8217;s even further confirmation that robots are going to be taking over our lives in the near future: robots could predict when someone was going to betray at a higher rate than humans on the basis of the linguistic cues alone. Woah!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you think of these studies? Let me know in the comments below, and thanks for reading!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hey everyone!
