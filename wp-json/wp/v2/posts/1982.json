Open rate represents the percentage of people who open my emails, which translates to more people showing up to our weekly meetings (and subsequently, funding for our club).<sup>1<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">1. It is important to note that open rate depends on the receiver downloading the &#8220;tracking image.&#8221; This automatic download is often disabled for Android devices, which translates into artificially lower open rates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Day First = Higher Open Rate<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking over the earlier data, I quickly noticed that putting the date first in the title of my emails led to higher open rates. For example, &#8220;Sunday Diplomacy&#8221; would perform much better than something like &#8220;Diplomacy Sunday.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1984\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/jorgezhang.com\/2019\/10\/mailchimp-tip-day-first-event-last\/screen-shot-2019-10-18-at-11-37-01-pm\/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screen-Shot-2019-10-18-at-11.37.01-PM.png?fit=596%2C371&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"596,371\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screen-Shot-2019-10-18-at-11.37.01-PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screen-Shot-2019-10-18-at-11.37.01-PM.png?fit=300%2C187&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screen-Shot-2019-10-18-at-11.37.01-PM.png?fit=596%2C371&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"596\" height=\"371\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screen-Shot-2019-10-18-at-11.37.01-PM.png?resize=596%2C371&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1984\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screen-Shot-2019-10-18-at-11.37.01-PM.png?w=596&amp;ssl=1 596w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screen-Shot-2019-10-18-at-11.37.01-PM.png?resize=300%2C187&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Putting the date first in the title of the email resulted in an ~8% greater open rate.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to acknowledge the small sample size, and so it is plausible that this is actually just a coincidence. In addition, the number of subscribers to our email list was not held constant (that being said, upon weighing the percentages based on the size of the email list, the roughly 8% greater open rate persisted).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why is this?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My hypothesis is that people have highly limited attention spans, and so putting the date first helps them process whether an event is relevant to them or not. I personally experience this in my life, receiving roughly 25 emails per day (and that&#8217;s not even including my personal email address!). Often times, I&#8217;ll wait for emails to build up a bit before mass-archiving any that don&#8217;t seem important or relevant to me. This inevitably results in me missing a crucial email from time to time, a problem that could be solved with more concise email titles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any thoughts on this method or why it appears to be true?
