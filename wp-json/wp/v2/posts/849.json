Making others lose Integrity is actually really good, and I&#8217;d argue usually better than gaining a RP. This makes Environmental Advocacy one of the best ways to pull ahead in RP for it&#8217;s cost. In addition, it also gives 2 Science Stat each year, which is pretty relevant actually.<\/p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"851\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/jorgezhang.com\/2018\/09\/miscellaneous-clubs\/theater\/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Theater.png?fit=1000%2C1400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1000,1400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Theater\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Theater.png?fit=214%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Theater.png?fit=731%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-851 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Theater.png?resize=317%2C443&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"317\" height=\"443\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Theater.png?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Theater.png?resize=214%2C300&amp;ssl=1 214w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Theater.png?resize=768%2C1075&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Theater.png?resize=731%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 731w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 317px) 100vw, 317px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Theater is the most expensive club in the game and has a negative immediate effect. With a RP value that is not that outstanding, this club would be terrible if not for its a fantastic Yearly ability. Gaining 8 Teacher Influence is really strong because it helps put rec pressure on important teachers. It also is very flexible since the teacher abilities cover a wide range of different effects. It is difficult to steal due to the price, with the downside of being a clear target for Budget Cuts in Junior Year. Still, this club can pay some serious dividends and is a solid investment.<\/p>\n<p>What do you think of these clubs?
