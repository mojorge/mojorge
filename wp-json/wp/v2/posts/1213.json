I got a lot of great feedback from Michael as well, and I really appreciate the amount of time and effort he volunteered to help create this video. Having taken an attempt at making gameplay videos myself, it is very difficult and can be unrewarding work at times. It&#8217;s also very difficult to avoid small mistakes, especially when playing someone else&#8217;s game with admittedly complex gameplay and just a rulebook in hand. Blue Giant Media did an amazing job with this. So thank you, Blue Giant Media!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you think of the gameplay video?
