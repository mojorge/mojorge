It has been buffed since then to be in line with the other negative value clubs, and also grants Friends at the end of every year to make up for a pretty crappy yearly effect. Gaining stress at the end of the year is pretty bad because it leaves one vulnerable to an attack in the next year, and risks a breakdown. However, in Poker&#8217;s case, it could be worth it to give a needed boost to a player&#8217;s Friend economy, or immediately gain some math stats for a class.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"831\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/jorgezhang.com\/2018\/08\/negative-value-clubs\/meme-connoisseurs\/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Meme-Connoisseurs.png?fit=1000%2C1400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1000,1400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Meme Connoisseurs\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Meme-Connoisseurs.png?fit=214%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Meme-Connoisseurs.png?fit=731%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-831 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Meme-Connoisseurs.png?resize=247%2C346&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"247\" height=\"346\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Meme-Connoisseurs.png?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Meme-Connoisseurs.png?resize=214%2C300&amp;ssl=1 214w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Meme-Connoisseurs.png?resize=768%2C1075&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Meme-Connoisseurs.png?resize=731%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 731w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 247px) 100vw, 247px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is one of my favorite clubs to get because it is a steroid club that immediately gives you 6 Friends in exchange for making it really hard to stockpile them in the future. The yearly isn&#8217;t as bad as it seems because you can choose the order of effects so that it doesn&#8217;t interfere with gaining friends through other clubs. Still, it is something to think about before picking this club up Freshman\/Sophomore year. I think this card is almost always worth it Junior and Senior year since you can minimize the damage from the yearly effect and the -1 RP is not that bad considering that 6 Friends can usually make that back up.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"832\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/jorgezhang.com\/2018\/08\/negative-value-clubs\/personal-fan-club\/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Personal-Fan-Club.png?fit=1000%2C1401&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1000,1401\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Personal Fan Club\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Personal-Fan-Club.png?fit=214%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Personal-Fan-Club.png?fit=731%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-832 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Personal-Fan-Club.png?resize=249%2C349&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"249\" height=\"349\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Personal-Fan-Club.png?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Personal-Fan-Club.png?resize=214%2C300&amp;ssl=1 214w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Personal-Fan-Club.png?resize=768%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Personal-Fan-Club.png?resize=731%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 731w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 249px) 100vw, 249px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This club is another &#8220;steroid&#8221; club that is basically free to pick up, and gives a lot of Happiness to boot. You need to own it to use one of the Essay cards, which is pretty cool. I also like how it seems naturally balanced: while it is better to get Junior or Senior year, Happiness tends to be worth less towards the end of the game. I also like this card thematically. It is pretty outrageous to have a club dedicated to your fans, which is what makes this hilarious to buy.<\/p>\n<p>What do you think of these clubs? Let me know in the comments below!
