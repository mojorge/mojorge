Recently I have been working on making a video for the contest, Cardboard Edison: https:\/\/cardboardedison.com\/award\/.

The dilemma is that my channel so far has been about Yu-Gi-Oh!, and so this is pretty much outside of what I would normally put on my channel. Then again, it&#8217;s been about 4 years since I have posted anything, and I might as well take advantage of it as I don&#8217;t really plan on making anymore Yu-Gi-Oh! videos. For now I set the video as unlisted to avoid either problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, this is completely unrelated, but I stumbled across this magician the other day and thought it was really amazing: <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/0IlNpoTyjlw\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/0IlNpoTyjlw<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still can&#8217;t figure out how he did all those tricks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s about all for now.
