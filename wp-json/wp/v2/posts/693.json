This card used to remove 4 Stats from an opponent. However, I didn&#8217;t like this very much since it discouraged players from stockpiling stats while it was out. In this change, playing this on another player can be somewhat planned around. It also is a direct counter to the Stats that Clubs provide at the end of each year. I think that this card will thus see more use as a way to stop an early club leader.<\/p>\n<p>A short note, I had fun with this card&#8217;s flavor text. While thinking of changes for what I felt a mediocre card design, I thought of how cyber bullying is often a continuous form of bullying that is overlooked\/ignored.<\/p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"696\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/jorgezhang.com\/2018\/08\/influence-cards-pt-2\/coup-stud-gov\/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Coup-Stud-Gov.png?fit=1000%2C1400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1000,1400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Coup Stud Gov\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Coup-Stud-Gov.png?fit=214%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Coup-Stud-Gov.png?fit=731%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-696 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Coup-Stud-Gov.png?resize=261%2C365&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"261\" height=\"365\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Coup-Stud-Gov.png?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Coup-Stud-Gov.png?resize=214%2C300&amp;ssl=1 214w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Coup-Stud-Gov.png?resize=768%2C1075&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Coup-Stud-Gov.png?resize=731%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 731w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 261px) 100vw, 261px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This was in a very early version of the game, and then was removed for the longest time.

You can find an article to the scandal here: <a href=\"http:\/\/nymag.com\/news\/features\/cheating-2012-9\/\">click me<\/a>. Essentially, one of the Stuyvesant students created a massive group chat where he would send the answers from the test to other students who were taking the test later, or at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>I liked the idea of having a card themed after this. While this card is relatively cheap, it also benefits your opponents if they don&#8217;t already have an A in the class. This way, it either helps the person behind in grades, or helps everyone.<\/p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"698\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/jorgezhang.com\/2018\/08\/influence-cards-pt-2\/mentally-scar\/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Mentally-Scar.png?fit=1000%2C1400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1000,1400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Mentally Scar\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Mentally-Scar.png?fit=214%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Mentally-Scar.png?fit=731%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-698 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Mentally-Scar.png?resize=257%2C360&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"257\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Mentally-Scar.png?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Mentally-Scar.png?resize=214%2C300&amp;ssl=1 214w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Mentally-Scar.png?resize=768%2C1075&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Mentally-Scar.png?resize=731%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 731w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 257px) 100vw, 257px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is another classic card that has surprisingly almost never seen any use.

I don&#8217;t especially like this change that much since the older version of hostile takeover was very elegant, but I think it&#8217;s necessary after the rule change and Stud Gov change in order to reduce redundancy. This card is now an investment-type card that gets better as more players lead clubs.
