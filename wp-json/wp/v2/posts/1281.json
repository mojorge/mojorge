Here is the main thing: they want to know that your game is <strong>almost or fully complete<\/strong>. I know that their site says that the game must be &#8220;available in its final form,&#8221; and what that really means is that the gameplay won&#8217;t change much and the game itself has already been playtested extensively. So make sure, before you submit, that your game is close to completion. Otherwise, mods are unlikely to approve your game. It kind of sucks, since in order to create a game, you need to build a following, which you need a BGG page for, which requires a completed game. It seems very catch-22, and the mods know that, and are sympathetic to individual publishers (at least that was my experience). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1296\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/jorgezhang.com\/2019\/03\/a-brief-guide-to-board-game-geek\/screen-shot-2019-03-19-at-9-43-21-pm\/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-9.43.21-PM.png?fit=1276%2C618&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1276,618\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2019-03-19 at 9.43.21 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-9.43.21-PM.png?fit=300%2C145&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-9.43.21-PM.png?fit=1024%2C496&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1276\" height=\"618\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-9.43.21-PM.png?fit=640%2C310\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1296\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-9.43.21-PM.png?w=1276&amp;ssl=1 1276w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-9.43.21-PM.png?resize=300%2C145&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-9.43.21-PM.png?resize=768%2C372&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-9.43.21-PM.png?resize=1024%2C496&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><figcaption>Major props to the mods.

It&#8217;s super important if you want to efficiently keep tabs on what people say about your game and you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What does subscribing do?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, whenever somebody says something about the thread, topic, game, person, etc. that you subscribed to, you get a notification. That is really important, because people could be asking questions about your game and post them in the forums. This way, you&#8217;ll know about it, rather than finding out several months later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Images, files, and stuff<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Images are the lifeblood of your game page. I would recommend uploading the best images you have for the game. Other people can upload images too, and it would be a good idea to encourage that! Having a few images at the start though so that people looking through your page can see them will help a lot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1300\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/jorgezhang.com\/2019\/03\/a-brief-guide-to-board-game-geek\/screen-shot-2019-03-19-at-10-11-05-pm\/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-10.11.05-PM.png?fit=1019%2C615&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1019,615\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2019-03-19 at 10.11.05 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-10.11.05-PM.png?fit=300%2C181&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-10.11.05-PM.png?fit=1019%2C615&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1019\" height=\"615\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-10.11.05-PM.png?resize=1019%2C615&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-10.11.05-PM.png?w=1019&amp;ssl=1 1019w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-10.11.05-PM.png?resize=300%2C181&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-10.11.05-PM.png?resize=768%2C464&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1019px) 100vw, 1019px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption>Uploading images<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4>Which gallery is my image?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Game<ul><li>Photos of the game: box, cards, components, etc. A rendered image could go under this category if it is by the publisher and not a miniature or custom die.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>People<ul><li>Are there humans prominently shown in the picture?

Primarily because people are visual creatures, which means that they will be much more likely to actually read about the game if they see something that catches their eye. The second reason is because people can give your images a thumbs up. I believe that the algorithms like this a lot, so the more people that do this, the higher your game will appear on the &#8220;hotness&#8221; list as well as in search results (at least, I think. I don&#8217;t have personal experience with this).

I won&#8217;t go into detail on how to do this in this post because it is pretty straightforward. But this would help someone who is very interested in your game to learn more about it. Other than that, I would not go overboard with forum posts and stuff like that. You ideally want other users to be contributing to your BGG page and posting their own images, etc. So encourage your reviewers or anyone who has your game to do this! It will help a ton.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ratings<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can rate any game on BGG, and you can even rate your own game!

If there are people who put your game on their wishlist, don&#8217;t hesitate to contact them! I almost got a reviewer this way, as Rahdo had put Daggers High on his wishlist. I contacted him through Geek Mail, and we talked for a bit, though unfortunately, he decided not to review the game and removed it from his wishlist due to his dislike of &#8220;take that&#8221; mechanics. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1304\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/jorgezhang.com\/2019\/03\/a-brief-guide-to-board-game-geek\/screen-shot-2019-03-19-at-10-44-03-pm\/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-10.44.03-PM.png?fit=759%2C670&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"759,670\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2019-03-19 at 10.44.03 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-10.44.03-PM.png?fit=300%2C265&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-10.44.03-PM.png?fit=759%2C670&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"759\" height=\"670\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-10.44.03-PM.png?resize=759%2C670&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1304\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-10.44.03-PM.png?w=759&amp;ssl=1 759w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-10.44.03-PM.png?resize=300%2C265&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption>These are some of the people who have added Daggers High to their collection <\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4>Logging plays<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This post is getting pretty long, so I&#8217;ll just briefly mention this here.

The first thing they see is going to be what I circled in red. Out of these, the most important thing is going to be your Avatar. Probably for good reason, people aren&#8217;t going to take you seriously if you don&#8217;t have an avatar. That&#8217;s because it is the #1 giveaway that you are a noob, and don&#8217;t use Board Game Geek that much. It costs 50 Geek Gold, so you likely won&#8217;t be able to get one immediately. This is easy to fix!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Geek Gold<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Geek gold is the currency of Board Game Geek, and you use it to buy your avatar, your microbadges, badges, overtext, and more.

I won&#8217;t go into that either, but it is there if you want to do that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>WIP Forum<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In the comments section, Benjamin brought up the WIP forum. The WIP forum is generally a place to post about games that aren&#8217;t yet ready for a BGG page. That being said, the line is blurred a bit, and the WIP forum can be a great place to let people know about what you are working on. I personally have found that it can be a bit overwhelming and that you can be completely drowned out by all the different games being discussed in the forums (I used to be subscribed to the WIP thread until it became too many notifications). In my case, I put up a game I am currently working on called Lord of Colors, and while I got a good response, after only a few days it was already on the second or third page of results. In my opinion, a BGG page is more valuable as it will be less likely to be buried by all the other WIP games. That being said, people are very active in this forum and you will likely get some level of response and following.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That about covers the basics, and honestly that&#8217;s all you really need to know. 80% of the difficulty of using BGG is setting it all up: after that you can sit back and relax as people start populating your game page. If you want a more hands-on approach, I would recommend using the forums frequently and becoming a member of the BGG community.
