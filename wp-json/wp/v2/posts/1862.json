I thought that I would just take a moment to share the new progress I&#8217;ve had with Daggers High. You may be aware that Daggers High recently launched and failed on Kickstarter. Although this was disappointing, I still wanted to find a way to get Daggers High into the hands of people. I found a way to do that, and it is quite affordable: on-demand printing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is on demand printing?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On Demand printing simply means that each time someone orders a copy of the game, one copy of that game is printed and sent out. This is incredibly inefficient price-wise since economy of scale works against you. That being said, it can be a good fit for simple games that involve a small number of components, especially if those components are generic. On the upside, you don&#8217;t need to print 1000 copies of a game in order to get it produced. I&#8217;m really glad something like print on demand is possible now, as it&#8217;s a great way to make smaller projects a reality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Where can I find Daggers High?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can find Daggers High on the Game Crafter here: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegamecrafter.com\/games\/daggers-highschool\">https:\/\/www.thegamecrafter.com\/games\/daggers-highschool<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me be clear: <strong>this is an abridged version of the game<\/strong>.  In order to keep costs down, several significant things had to be done:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>No Game Box<\/li><li>Removed the FUN entirely (and all associated event cards)<\/li><li>Removed Essays entirely (and all associated event cards)<\/li><li>Removed Achievements entirely<\/li><li>Cut 6 Clubs, 6 Influence Cards, and 12 Event Cards<\/li><li>25 small cubes instead of 36 per player. No medium cubes included.<\/li><li>Removed dice.<\/li><li>Removed special characters <\/li><li>Smaller player boards<\/li><li>I make 0 profit off of sales<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to all of this cost cutting, I was able to bring the cost per game to just $36.83. You&#8217;ll also have to pay for shipping though, and for me it says it costs $8.07, which means that in total you would be paying around $48.70 per copy. That being said, it&#8217;s a way to experience the game, and so my ultimate hope is that this allows people to still purchase, play, and enjoy Daggers High.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Prototype copies<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to have your own copy of Daggers High, I still have prototype copies left and am more than happy to sell them! I am selling them at $49 per copy, but it comes with the full game included. Here&#8217;s a picture of the prototype copy:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1863\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/jorgezhang.com\/2019\/07\/purchase-daggers-high-on-the-game-crafter\/in-the-box\/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/In-the-box.jpg?fit=4000%2C3000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4000,3000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.2&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Mi A2 Lite&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1547463183&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;3.82&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;320&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.033333333333333&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"In the box\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/In-the-box.jpg?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/In-the-box.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/In-the-box.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1863\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/In-the-box.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/In-the-box.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/In-the-box.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/In-the-box.jpg?resize=1800%2C1350&amp;ssl=1 1800w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/In-the-box.jpg?resize=576%2C432&amp;ssl=1 576w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/In-the-box.jpg?w=2400&amp;ssl=1 2400w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/In-the-box.jpg?w=3600&amp;ssl=1 3600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption>Daggers High<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you think of print on demand?
