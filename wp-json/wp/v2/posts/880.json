Just wanted to talk about a couple of Essays that were changed today to be more in line with &#8220;Magnum Opus&#8221;. Magnum Opus gives 1 RP for every 2 Happiness, rounded down. These two clubs do similar things depending on the number of Stress or Clubs you had. However, while I really liked the design of these clubs, I felt that they too heavily rewarded players who gained a lot of Stress, or pursued a lot of clubs. In some games, these clubs have been worth 8-9 RP, and leadership has potential to be even more. This is a ton in comparison to Recs, the FUN, and RP from classes! I think that these essays are a lot more reasonable now.<\/p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"881\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/jorgezhang.com\/2018\/09\/minor-essay-changes\/1159-essay-2\/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/1159-essay.png?fit=1000%2C1400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1000,1400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"1159 essay\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/1159-essay.png?fit=214%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/1159-essay.png?fit=731%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone  wp-image-881\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/1159-essay.png?resize=268%2C376&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"268\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/1159-essay.png?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/1159-essay.png?resize=214%2C300&amp;ssl=1 214w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/1159-essay.png?resize=768%2C1075&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/1159-essay.png?resize=731%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 731w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 268px) 100vw, 268px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/>\u00a0<img data-attachment-id=\"883\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/jorgezhang.com\/2018\/09\/minor-essay-changes\/leadership-2\/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Leadership.png?fit=3143%2C4400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3143,4400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Leadership\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Leadership.png?fit=214%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Leadership.png?fit=731%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone  wp-image-883\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Leadership.png?resize=266%2C372&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"266\" height=\"372\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Leadership.png?w=3143&amp;ssl=1 3143w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Leadership.png?resize=214%2C300&amp;ssl=1 214w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Leadership.png?resize=768%2C1075&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Leadership.png?resize=731%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 731w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Leadership.png?w=2400&amp;ssl=1 2400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 266px) 100vw, 266px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Also, since I don&#8217;t want to make a separate post for this, Valedictorian has been changed back to 0 RP. People were disappointed after I changed the card to 3 RP! I agreed. I think it is a lot funnier if it isn&#8217;t worth any RP because then the players get all hyped about being Valedictorian for nothing. Plus, perfect grade bonuses has made Valedictorian somewhat obsolete anyway.<\/p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"884\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/jorgezhang.com\/2018\/09\/minor-essay-changes\/valedictorian-3\/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Valedictorian.png?fit=1000%2C1400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1000,1400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Valedictorian\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Valedictorian.png?fit=214%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Valedictorian.png?fit=731%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-884 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Valedictorian.png?resize=332%2C465&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"332\" height=\"465\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Valedictorian.png?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Valedictorian.png?resize=214%2C300&amp;ssl=1 214w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Valedictorian.png?resize=768%2C1075&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Valedictorian.png?resize=731%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 731w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 332px) 100vw, 332px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>What did you think of these changes?
