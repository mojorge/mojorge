The rules are simple: you have 24 hours to design a tabletop game. Also, the game must include some element of &#8220;bureaucracy&#8221;. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, I have been kicking around this idea of a mechanic for exploring a dungeon for a while, and I wanted to try it out. So then I realized that instead of exploring a dungeon, I could take advantage of this contest and have the players explore an office! Unfortunately, that seemed really dull, and I felt that I needed to make something a little bit more interesting. I also needed there to be a reason that you are avoiding enemies, or in this case your employees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1183\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/jorgezhang.com\/2019\/03\/did-i-seriously-just-make-a-game-called-naked-ceos\/forblog\/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/forBlog.png?fit=284%2C427&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"284,427\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"forBlog\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/forBlog.png?fit=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/forBlog.png?fit=284%2C427&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"284\" height=\"427\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/forBlog.png?resize=284%2C427&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1183\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/forBlog.png?w=284&amp;ssl=1 284w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/forBlog.png?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 284px) 100vw, 284px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption>Mr. Bean was the inspiration for this game.<br><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s when I remembered what is perhaps my favorite Mr. Bean moment ever: he locks himself outside of his hotel room, and he&#8217;s naked. So he goes around the hotel hiding from the other guests, looking for clothes. It&#8217;s really funny, and exactly the kind of reason that you&#8217;d be hiding from your employees! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the premise of the game is that you are a wealthy CEO, and you wake up naked for some unexplained reason. If you are the first player to collect all 4 pieces of clothing you win the game. Alternatively, each time you are caught by an employee you must bribe them with 1 million dollars of your salary. If you are the last player with a salary, you also win the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1184\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/jorgezhang.com\/2019\/03\/did-i-seriously-just-make-a-game-called-naked-ceos\/img_20190301_103928\/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/IMG_20190301_103928.jpg?fit=4000%2C3000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4000,3000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.2&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Mi A2 Lite&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1551436768&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;3.82&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;125&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.033333333333333&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"IMG_20190301_103928\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/IMG_20190301_103928.jpg?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/IMG_20190301_103928.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/IMG_20190301_103928.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1184\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/IMG_20190301_103928.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/IMG_20190301_103928.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/IMG_20190301_103928.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/IMG_20190301_103928.jpg?resize=1800%2C1350&amp;ssl=1 1800w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/IMG_20190301_103928.jpg?resize=576%2C432&amp;ssl=1 576w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/IMG_20190301_103928.jpg?w=2400&amp;ssl=1 2400w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/IMG_20190301_103928.jpg?w=3600&amp;ssl=1 3600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption>An example of a <g class=\"gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"4\" data-gr-id=\"4\">playtest<\/g> of the game. I didn&#8217;t even bother printing half the cards or the tokens since honestly it would probably be a waste of ink. Luckily the game is super simple, so it was pretty easy to substitute the pieces, and use some of the original paper cards I made in the concept phase.<br><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, I was surprised to find that I really enjoyed playing the game when I was playing it, mostly for the humor value. There is also some strategy going on here, which I was happy to see. There&#8217;s a ton of luck, but I think it&#8217;s a little bit forgivable considering the theme. That being said, there are a few pretty significant issues that I didn&#8217;t get to fix as the contest is only so long. Firstly, sometimes you can miss that a newly placed room contains a piece of clothing since you have to keep referencing the 4 clothing cards. Secondly, the game can drag on&#8230; especially if the right rooms are not being drawn. This is doubly bad since it takes up a ton of table space. Finally, there are some minor placement issues and some edge cases where it could be impossible to place a room. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, the contest voting is open right now, and I would really appreciate it if you checked it out! You can find the voting for the contest open on Board Game Geek here: <a href=\"https:\/\/boardgamegeek.com\/geeklist\/253686\/24-hour-contest-february-2019\">https:\/\/boardgamegeek.com\/geeklist\/253686\/24-hour-contest-february-2019<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Would you actually play this game, or is it terrible?
