One of the issues was that it was difficult to tell which box meant which effect. Several players have confused the yearly ability for the immediate ability, or accidentally used the Resume Point value as the amount of Friends to purchase it. For very new players, it was difficult to find out how much each club cost.<\/p>\n<p>I think that as players get more used to the cards, these problems go away. However, to make it easier for a new player, I decided to rework the design a bit.<\/p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"790\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/jorgezhang.com\/2018\/08\/new-club-design\/poker-3\/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Poker-2.png?fit=1000%2C1401&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1000,1401\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Poker\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Poker-2.png?fit=214%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Poker-2.png?fit=731%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone  wp-image-790\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Poker-2.png?resize=284%2C398&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"284\" height=\"398\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Poker-2.png?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Poker-2.png?resize=214%2C300&amp;ssl=1 214w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Poker-2.png?resize=768%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Poker-2.png?resize=731%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 731w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 284px) 100vw, 284px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now, the Friend cost is in a red circle, which draws a person&#8217;s attention to it quickly.
