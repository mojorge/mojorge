If you enjoy puzzles, you will enjoy the Cryptex Hunt. I also participated last year, and I have to say that the Cryptex Hunt is consistently my favorite puzzle hunt of them all. Part of the reason why is the fact that it generally starts off with easier puzzles and gets progressively harder. That means I can actually do some of the puzzles, unlike a couple of online puzzle hunts where I literally was unable to solve any of the puzzles correctly. Secondly, the puzzles are fantastic. They always are very thematic, interesting, and beyond &#8220;clever.&#8221; Honestly, I can&#8217;t run out of good things to say about the people who run the Cryptex Hunt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the primary reason I enjoy the Cryptex Hunt is because the community surrounding it is so helpful. People aren&#8217;t afraid to give you hints and work together on puzzles with you. I collaborated with many different people from all different skill levels and puzzle abilities, and contributing to each-other was the best part of the puzzle hunt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, check it out here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cryptexhunt.com\/2019\/\"><g class=\"gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_hide gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace replaceWithoutSep replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"4\" data-gr-id=\"4\">http:\/\/www.cryptexhunt.com\/2019\/<\/g><\/a><g class=\"gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_hide gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Style multiReplace replaceWithoutSep replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"4\" data-gr-id=\"4\"> !<\/g> If you do, I promise that I will make time to help you get started. You have until the end of March to solve all of the puzzles, and then you have a chance to win a Cryptex!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still need convincing? Let me show you a short small-spoiler tour of some of the puzzles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1242\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/jorgezhang.com\/2019\/03\/cryptex-hunt-2019\/screen-shot-2019-03-01-at-9-22-23-pm\/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screen-Shot-2019-03-01-at-9.22.23-PM-e1552189967655.png?fit=1421%2C813&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1421,813\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2019-03-01 at 9.22.23 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screen-Shot-2019-03-01-at-9.22.23-PM-e1552189967655.png?fit=300%2C172&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screen-Shot-2019-03-01-at-9.22.23-PM-e1552189967655.png?fit=1024%2C586&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/jorgezhang.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screen-Shot-2019-03-01-at-9.22.23-PM.png?resize=1024%2C640&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1242\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><figcaption>Google Maps lets you see indoors???<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This puzzle had me using google maps to find the code- how cool is that?
