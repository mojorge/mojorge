The secrecy of each player&#8217;s cash reserves and the long calculation to determine final stock value made it a mystery who was winning the game until the very last turn, which kept it suspenseful and competitive to the very end. Although we had some apprehensions about how the game would progress with such limited starting capital, we found that the game flowed surprisingly well on it own, a mark of good design and calculations on the game designers&#8217; behalf. The game is traditional in the sense that it uses common play mechanisms and goals, but demonstrates creativity in its own right, especially in the way corporations take the role as primary actors, not players themselves. For anyone willing to stick it out for a solid 30 minutes of attempting to understand complicated gameplay, this game promises intense industrial steampunk glory. Final rating: 6.1\/10<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In your opinion, what game is the hardest to learn the rules to?
