Over the past few days I have been writing up an official rulebook for Daggers High.

I have incorporated most of them into the newest version of the rulebook, which I have now re-uploaded as Daggers High Rulebook V3.4. For now, this is the finalized version of the rulebook. That being said, please let me know if you have any other suggestions or feedback on how to make things clearer and better!
