Today I thought I&#8217;d share a photo of a play test at the Westmont Public Library. This was a two-player play test with both players never having completed a game before. The game took just under 2 hours, including the explanation of the rules. The comments were overall pretty positive. One of the comments that I thought was interesting was that the game might have been easier if each player had note pads to jot down what they planned to do. Because of the concentration needed to play each turn, it became difficult to talk and also make plays at the same time. It also was difficult to compare different options mentally. One other thing that I have been noticing for a while now is that later years tend to take longer than the earlier years. This is the opposite of what I initially expected since I had assumed that players would be faster as they get more accustomed to the game. What I think ends up happening though is that as players have more resources such as Stats, Friends or Teacher Influence, they also have more decisions to make on their turn. It could also reflect more overall actions being taken since the later decks contain cards with higher action points than the earlier ones.<\/p>\n<p>Overall it was a very useful play test. I hope to be back at the library again for another one of their board game programs in a few months!
