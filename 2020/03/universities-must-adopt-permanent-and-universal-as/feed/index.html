					<description><![CDATA[I couldn&#039;t agree more. I have personally seen students (my own daughter) &quot;play school&quot; well. Learning is set aside as an after thought in our current system of education. Great read!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jorgezhang.com/2020/03/universities-must-adopt-permanent-and-universal-as/#comment-8657&quot;&gt;Zachary Moore&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks Zach! The terminology &quot;Universal A&quot; and &quot;Double A&quot; might be specific to Georgetown, though people have been calling to abolish grades for quite a while. Even more generally than grades, studies have shown that rewards seem to restrict creativity. As it turns out, grading for &quot;creativity&quot; also doesn&#039;t work! As soon as students have found a creative idea/twist that seems to result in a higher creativity score, they stick within the confines of that idea. Ultimately, the reason you cannot grade creativity is because true creativity requires the possibility of failure. Yet, students aren&#039;t going to take that risk of failure if their grade is depending on it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jorge, this is a really good read. I have never before heard of the calls for universal A&#039;s, but it seems like a creative, reasonable solution to the very real problems you identified.

Your thoughts about essay rubrics hit home with me especially. All year, I&#039;ve been frustrated by the fact that my class readings spark a lot of ideas, but those ideas are stifled by essay rubrics that limit me to a handful of preset topics. That means I can either write about what interested me and find a flimsy connection to the rubric, or bore myself to tears writing somebody else&#039;s thoughts on my essay.]]></description>
