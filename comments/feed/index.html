Thank you,]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] When our group was presented with Blockers the Stacking Game, we did not know quite what to expect. We were presented with a rectangular box, covered in colorful, geometric representations of the blocks within. Inside this was filled with wooden painted blocks, as well as cards featuring all manner of balanced towers and spires in similar geometric fashion. Everything had a lighthearted, vibrant aesthetic which helped lend added brevity to the game’s feel.(Note: Our group reviewed a previous version of this game, which you can find here) [&#8230;]]]></description>
