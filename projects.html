This page is where I will document all the interesting/fun projects I've worked on.

Walter Payton College Prep the Video Game by Jorge Zhang

This was based off of one of the very first iterations of Daggers High. The only difference is that it is single player. It is still clunky and probably buggy, but you can play through the whole game if you had the determination to (and not drop out)!

Real Rank by Jorge Zhang and David Hafner

We thought that US News and Report didn't do justice to properly rank Illinois high schools, so we decided to do it ourselves! Made on the principle that every individual is looking for something different, and so the rankings adjust based off of a few criteria.

Puddle by Jorge Zhang, David Hafner, Lucas Pauker, and four people we met randomly

This was made during a coding competition. The idea was something that would write your own English essays for you: we failed miserably, but our results were hilarious! So instead of branding ourselves as an automatic essay writer, we made it into a comedic short story generator called Puddle.
